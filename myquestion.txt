We had knowledge transfer on claim segmentation projects, which involves both claim complexity and claim severity module, I have a better understanding of claim complexity model now. I am enriching the claim segmentation wiki page, but there still exists a couple of questions and thoughts like
1.	The severity model, although not touched by we data scientists at SAIF, of which the code base is stored in \\Slmfs1\salemdev\BDS_CLMSEG\Final_Deliverables\Severity Module, do you know where is this directory?
2.	I saw SQL procedures in bdsqa9 ANALYTICS_DB, but I am not able to access it. And Shri said the inference procedures are under another database, can you direct me to the right place?
3.	want to talk about know issues and the status of migrating claim complexity module to databricks.
4.	talk about future maintenance/monitoring plan - does severity module also need to be migrated? how hard will the model monitoring be? any scheduled recalibration/retraining? just random talk and note them down, I think this year we may just start with migrating claim complexity module
